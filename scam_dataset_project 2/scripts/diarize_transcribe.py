# diarize_transcribe.py (high-level)
# Template to run diarization (pyannote) and ASR (whisper/openai-whisper).
# This file is a guide â€” actual model usage needs proper setup (pyannote pipelines, HuggingFace tokens, GPU).

    # diarization = pipeline(wav_path)
    # Save diarization to JSON with segments
